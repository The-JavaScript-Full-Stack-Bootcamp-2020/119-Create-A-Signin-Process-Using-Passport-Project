The JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp: LEVEL 25 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION (Lesson 119)

In this project we use an awesome tool to handle authentication, Passport. It can handle tons of different authentication methods, and itâ€™s a very popular package to manage this task in the Node.js ecosystem.

Here we implement a simple authentication workflow using Passport, Node, Sequelize and Postgres. It is a pretty standard signup/login process and proves to be a valuable example that could be used in future projects.
